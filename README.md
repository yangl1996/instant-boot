# Linux Instant Boot
Research project at CECA, Peking University.

# Main Idea
* Use RAM-Disk
* Only include essential drivers and modules
* Use X.org as X11 server
* Linux Kernel parameter is set to "quiet", but not used (Use U-Boot params instead)
* Have basic network functions (inter-process sockets) for X11
