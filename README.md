# No-GUI version configuration

## Main Idea

* Remove all unneeded modules and drivers (Graphic drivers are no deleted)
* Use RAM-disk
* Remove serial output from U-Boot and Linux Kernel
* CPU performance set to highest possible configuration

## U-Boot Modification

Modified U-Boot is also on GitHub.
